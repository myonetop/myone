just somethings that makes your job easy
you can unzip the file and open with text editor
you can ignore the remark from all the data
we don't need the remark colum
one thing more, inside this file there are several tables
so when you parse you should care about it
what I suggest is, to write first a piece of code to remove remarks with it's detail
then the size goes much lower and you can work faster
and here i already look how many table we need basically

1. write code to remove all remarks from file
2. write a code to separately copy each table content in a new file
3. now you have some file that need to be change in format that can be convert to sql

I have a two page python app using flask framework. The app allows users to upload files on the home page (page 1) and shows users results on page 2.

I need a few simple modifications:

1. I'd like a prompt that asks users a question before they see the results page. We'll collect the users answers

2. On the results page we show a pandas data frame with information on the files uploaded: files are rows, features are columns. I want the user to be able to add columns to the table.

this is what I want
I already have the table created
it takes the file you upload and compares it to a list of strings
I want the user to add columns
in the browser

ok so this is the first task
the second one is much easier

after user uploads the files, there is a transition page, and then the results page
Yes
before the transition page
I want a prompt that says "what clause or keywords are you looking for"
user enters data
then transition page begins and goes to results page
