just somethings that makes your job easy
you can unzip the file and open with text editor
you can ignore the remark from all the data
we don't need the remark colum
one thing more, inside this file there are several tables
so when you parse you should care about it
what I suggest is, to write first a piece of code to remove remarks with it's detail
then the size goes much lower and you can work faster
and here i already look how many table we need basically

1. write code to remove all remarks from file
2. write a code to separately copy each table content in a new file
3. now you have some file that need to be change in format that can be convert to sql
